# A review of "Effects of Defectors on Greedy Routing in Complex Networks"

#### _Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?_

It looks like you are replicating a game, in which some nodes have to balance trade-offs from delivering messages - it costs them to send a message, but they are rewarded for sending it successfully, and the behavior of each node can either be random or depend on its neighbors. This seems to answer the question, what is the effect of defectors on greedy routing in complex networks? Which is pretty clearly the point of your project, so good job!

#### _Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?_

I think I understand your methodology, but I'm a little confused by the fact that _k_ is a "feature..." What is a feature? I also think that it makes sense that the physical distance between two nodes represents their similarity in your graphs - nice explanation! There are a few typos and formatting errors in this part of the report ("Each node also also has a theta" and some of your figures' captions are a little misplaced), but overall, your methodology seems pretty solid.

#### _Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?_

The visualizations are pretty effective; they definitely helped me understand what your explanations were referring to, and your figures are all labeled, which is great. Some of the labels on your figures could be clearer/more detailed, and I think maybe when you're explaining how a graph works, you should just put the explanation in the graph's caption (for example, the whole paragraph that starts with "As can be seen in Figure 1" could probably just be a caption under figure 1, since you're not analyzing anything - just explaining how the graph works).

I didn't really understand what was going on in Figure 4, as there isn't really an explanation for what the colors mean. (Logically, I assume brighter colors mean something important, but I think this figure could be clearer.)

#### _Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?_

I think your interpretation of the results is reasonable and answers your motivating question. It also makes sense to me, even as someone who doesn't know everything about your experiment nor the original paper, so I think it holds a lot of water.

#### _Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how?_

I don't know what the results in the original paper look like, but I'm assuming that you did replicate it successfully because you have a lot of awesome graphs and visualizations. Maybe you should include something in your paper about what the results of the original paper were.

#### _Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?_

I think your extension is sensible and compelling - it's basically improving the original algorithm, right? And I like that you related it to the real world/argued that your proposed improvement to the algorithm would reflect real world behaviors more accurately.

#### _Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?_

Yeah, definitely! You guys have done some really nice work and made a lot of progress. If anything, you're probably 10 minutes' worth of proofreading away from being completely done with this project. Nice job!

#### _Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?_

The language is pretty clear and concise overall, although you have a few typos and grammatical errors scattered throughout. It doesn't seem to violate Allen's style guide recs very much, but do comb through your report one more time to make sure you iron out the typos.

#### _Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?_

Everything looks good and correct, although I'm not sure if your bibliographies are all formatted correctly. (The last item, "Epidemic Spreading in Scale-Free Networks Pastor-Satorras, Romualdo; Vespignani, Allesandro;", is particularly suspicious.)
